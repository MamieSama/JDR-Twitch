## Why should I use this extension as a Just Dance Streamer ?

With this extension you can make it easier for your viewers to requests songs.  
They can search through all the songs directly on Twitch without visiting e.g. the Just Dance Wiki.  
A preview of the song as well as its stats (difficutly, effort, coach count) can also be seen in the extension.

You as a streamer can configure the extension with the game version (Just Dance 2016-2022), if you have Just Dance Unlimited as well as banning certain songs from being requested.

## Features

- üíÉ Just Dance support from 2016 onwards including Just Dance Unlimited

## Development Instructions

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention**: This section is only interesting to you if you are a developer and want to contribute to the project.

### Building the Extension

To build the extension you need the following:

- NodeJS v11+ (Tested with 16.6.2)
- Yarn (Tested with 3.0.1)

```bash
# Install Dependencies
yarn install

# Server Environments
# - prod: Production Server
# - dev: Development Server
# - local: Local Test Server

# Build minified (Will create extension.zip in dist/rollup/)
SERVER=prod yarn bundle-extension

# Bundles all source files needed for the Twitch Review process
SERVER=prod yarn bundle-sources

# Build non-minified
SERVER=prod yarn build

# Build with file watch
SERVER=prod yarn watch
```

### Host Assets

Hosting assets statically on `localhost`

```bash
yarn server-static
```

### Technical Problems / Common Issues

If the extension can't load it is probably due to the fact that twitch only allows `https` connections. So either you need a ssl certificate for localhost or you can enable insecure localhost. This can be done as follows:

1. Navigate to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost`
2. Change the flag to enabled
3. Restart your browser

Documentation on this topic can be found [here](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions#develop-your-extension).
